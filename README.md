# -Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-in-Python-Flask
This project focuses on Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using various machine learning regression models, with a highlight on the Random Forest Regressor.


Summary 
This machine learning project aimed to demystify how individual characteristics influence medical insurance costs. Utilizing a suitable dataset, the development process was comprehensive, beginning with crucial data preparation steps: exploring features, converting categorical variables to numerical formats, and extensive data visualization via heatmaps and plots to analyze feature dependency, skew, and kurtosis. 

The project systematically trained and compared the predictive performance of several algorithms, including Linear Regression, SVR, Ridge Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. After rigorous hyperparameter tuning to optimize all models, the Random Forest Regressor emerged as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 86% in predicting medical insurance charges. The final, optimized model was then prepared and successfully deployed using Flask, making the predictive system operational.
